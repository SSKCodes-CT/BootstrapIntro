# BootstrapIntro
CodingTemple Module One Bootstrap Assignment
1. Responsive form made with bootstrap with First and last names. email. password fields
2. I didn't have to put the @ in the middle of the email fields but I liked the look and it seems like validating would be easier with the domain seperate and there would be no need to check for containing the @
3. First and Last name are next to each other on large screens, this WILL change on small screen sizes. I couldn't find a way that makes sense and has them layed out the same way on small screens.
4. Checkbox for agreeing to terms and is required
5. Button-success styled submut button for form 
6. Hard coded table with sample data like the site has collected data from its users
7. Table is styled with bootstrap hover and stripe effects, is responsive.
8. navbar works links to all three pages as does the 'logo' aka the site name in the navbar.
9. Hamburger menu displays properly -this uses Javascript which is in the next module- I had to troubleshoot with AI to find this as Coding temple did not teach me prior to assigning this project.
10. Navbar covered up the h2 h1 and any content at the top -fixed by using sticky-top found on bootstrap's website.
11. use of container-fluid to stlye page includeing for the main image and button sizes. 
12. used a rounded image and added an border (border not required I just think it looks better), I used class=rounded-circle and d-block to make a circular image out of a square image.
13. I used d-none and d-md-block to make visable and disappearing buttons labled with what screen they would be using as PC button is invisible on mobile
14. I didn't have to use media queries as the website was already behaving responsivly unless you count d-none and d-md-block
